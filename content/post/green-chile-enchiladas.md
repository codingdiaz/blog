I have been doing a fair amount of cooking lately, I typically use recipes to cook but, I rarely follow them exactly. Tonight I made a recipe of my own, I plan to start sharing more of what I cook.

## Ingredients
* 15oz can of black beans
* 1 box of yellow spanish style rice
    * I get mine from Aldi, it looks like [this](https://www.instacart.com/products/17498251-pueblo-lindo-spanish-style-yellow-rice-8-oz)
* 15 oz can of [green chile enchilada sauce](https://thrivemarket.com/p/hatch-chili-company-medium-green-chile-enchilada-sauce)
* 4 oz can of [diced green chiles](https://www.walmart.com/grocery/ip/Old-El-Paso-Mild-Chopped-Green-Chiles-4-5-oz-Can/10313175) (mild)
* About 10 corn tortillas (any color)
* 1 roma tomato (diced small)
* 1 small (or half of large) onion diced
* 1 bell pepper (any color) diced
* 1/2 cup of mexican style shredded cheese
    * you can use colby jack, mexican blend, etc.
* paprika
* garlic powder
* chili powder
* cilantro chopped (optional)

### For the Guacamole
* 1 tablespoon sour cream
* 2 avocados
* Half a lime
* salt/pepper
* onion powder
* small spoon of diced roma tomatoes

## Instructions

* Preheat your oven to 350 degrees
* Start the spanish rice according to the directions, the rice will likely take about 25 minutes to cook
* Dice the onion and bell pepper
* Dice the roma tomato and set aside
* Heat a medium frying pan to medium/high heat, add about 1 tablespoon (olive oil or vegetable oil), saut√© the onion and bell pepper until tender, about 6 minutes. When these are done, turn the heat off and set aside.
* Open the can of black beans and leave a bit of the can attached, drain beans in the can, rinse the beans about 5 times by filling the can with water and draining (this leaves some of the juices in the beans but gets most of it rinsed off)
* Pour the black beans into a bowl and microwave for a minute, mash the beans with a fork, they don't have to be fully mashed but try to break up most of the beans
* Mix in the following to the mashed beans and mix well:
    * 1 tsp garlic powder
    * 1 tsp chili powder
    * 1 tsp onion powder
    * 1 tsp paprika 
* Prepare the guacamole:
    * put the 2 avocados in a bowl (skin and pit removed)
    * squeeze half a lime into this
    * add a small handful of diced roma tomato
    * add tablespoon of sour cream
    * season with dash of salt, pepper and onion powder
    * mash/mix with fork to desired consistency
* In a 13x9 casserole dish, pour about 1/3 of the can of green chile enchilada sauce and move the pan around to coat the bottom of the dish
* Heat a small frying pan on high heat and add a touch of oil
* Do the following until the casserole dish is full:
    * heat a tortilla on each side for about 15 seconds (put another one on while you prepare the one you took off)
    * on a small plate, add a scoop of beans and scoop of veggies, roll, place in casserole dish seam side down
* Cover enchiladas with rest of enchilada sauce, make sure the tops are coated
* Pour can of green chiles on top making sure it is even across the dish
* Sprinkle shredded cheese on top
* Bake for 15-20 minutes, it is done when the cheese is melted and you just want to eat it!
* Put desired enchiladas on plate, put rice next to it, top with guacamole, the rest of the tomatoes and chopped cilantro
