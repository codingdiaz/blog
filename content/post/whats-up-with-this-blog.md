Welcome! If you made it this far, thank you 🙏! I have been contemplating
starting a blog for some time now. 

My biggest blocker to starting is the fact that
I am a person of many interests. I enjoy cooking, brewing beer, technology, traveling and much more. I could never pick one "topic" for my blog, so today **I pick them all**. 

So, why did I start a blog?

* A way to think through my thoughts, if others enjoy a post that is awesome too. 🎉
* To improve my writing. 
* To have a central place to share my thoughts

My backlog of posts is stirring in my head, stay tuned for more!
